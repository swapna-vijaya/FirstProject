    <h1>Wildlife trade refers to the products that are derived from non-domesticated animals
         or plants usually extracted from their natural environment or raised under controlled conditions.
          It can involve the trade of living or dead individuals, tissues such as skins, bones or meat, or
           other products. Legal wildlife trade is regulated by the United Nations' Convention on 
         Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which currently has 184 member countries called Parties.</h1>
